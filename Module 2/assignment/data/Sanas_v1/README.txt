--- VERSION ---
v.1

--- DESCRIPTION ---

* This is the first version of the lyrics (san'as) corpus for the Arab-Andalusian collection.
* As of now, we have gathered the lyrics for the songs in our collection that belong to the nawbas "Isbahan", "Maya" and "Raml Maya".
* Lyrics are stored in two formats: as Tab Separated Values (TSV) files and as JSON files.
* Each file is identified by its MusicBrainz recording ID (MBID).
* The lyrics are stored both in their original arabic script (folder 'original') and a romanized/transliterated version (folder 'transliterated')
  using the American Library of Congress (ALA-LC standard).
* The included metadata file ('metadata.tsv') provides the recording names of the lyrics files and the Internet Archive URL, so that
  researchers can also download their corresponding audio files.

--- IN PROGESS ---
* Please note that the the lyrics corpus is still unde construction. We are currently still working on the lyrics of the remaining
  nawbas and improving the romanization of the lyrics.
