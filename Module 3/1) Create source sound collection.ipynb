The collection of sounds is created by defining a number of queries to be performed using the Freesound API and concatenanting the results of each query. A number of metadata fields are stored for each sound in the collection and saved into a Pandas DataFrame object and CSV file in disk. For each sound in the collection, we also download an OGG preview and store it in disk.\n","\n","This notebook uses the `freesound` Python package for interacting with the Freesound API. The source code for this package can be found here: https://github.com/mtg/freesound-python. In this repository you'll find a Python script with [examples](https://github.com/MTG/freesound-python/blob/master/examples.py) to learn how to interact with the API. Nevertheless, if you are further interested in the Freesound API, check the [API documentation](http://freesound.org/docs/api/) which provides more information.\n","\n","**NOTE**: A Freesound API key is provided in this notebook, but you should make a Freesound account and get your own key.
