# Audio-and-Music-Processing-Lab
Instructors: Rafael Caro Repetto, Frederic Font, Dmitry Bogdanov, plus other researchers from the MTG

Credits: 5 ECTS

This is a hands-on lab/seminar, which complements the technologies and methodologies covered by the core courses of the Master's program. Thus this course focuses on different datasets, such as large-scale music data and machine-readable music scores, and encourages the student to go beyond the mainstream 'engineering-only' approach, by introducing methodologies from musicology and ethnomusicology. The course offers the opportunity to engage with some of the technologies and research projects currently carried out at the MTG by their leading researchers.
